# QMC_grid_theory

Repository contains a reference Python implementation of the quantum Monte-Carlo algorithm allowing to sample fermion wave functions represented on Cartesian grids. The current version of the code is capable of calculating the energies of the non-interacting fermions confined by harmonic potentials in one-dimensional space. Arbitrary spin states are allowed.
